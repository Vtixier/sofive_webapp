                    <h2>DIGITAL TERMS OF USE</h2>
<p>These Digital Terms of Use (together with the Additional Terms set forth herein, “Terms”) set forth the terms and conditions applicable to and governing your access to and use of the websites and applications designed for download and use on mobile, table, smart watch and other personal devices, and all features, functionalities, services and Content (as defined herein) made available through such websites and applications (collectively, “Digital Properties”) made available Sofive Soccer Centers (“Sofive Soccer Centers”). By using the Digital Properties, and the features and services made available through the Digital Properties, you are acknowledging that you have read, understand and agreed to these Terms and expressly agree that they form a binding contract between you and Sofive Soccer Centers.</p>
 
</p><h2>CHANGES TO THE TERMS</h2><p>
These Terms may change as we continue to evolve our business, as well as the Digital Properties or any portion thereof. If we change these Terms, we will post the revised document here and such changes will be effective immediately upon that posting. Your continued use of the Digital Properties constitutes your acceptance of such changes and agreement to be bound by the modified Terms, and so we recommend that you review these Terms periodically when accessing or using the Digital Properties.
 
</p><h2>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h2><p>
Informal Dispute Resolution Our goal is to do our best to ensure that every experience with Sofive Soccer Centers will exceed your expectations. If that doesn’t happen, we hope you will give us the opportunity to try to address any problem or concern. To do so, please contact us by emailing us at info@sofive.com. When contacting us, we ask that you include your name, address, phone number and email address, and a description of your problem or concern and any specific relief you seek.
</p><h2>Arbitration Agreement</h2><p>
By using the Digital Properties, you and Sofive Soccer Centers agree to submit any and all Disputes (as defined below) to binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the United States Code), which shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement (“Arbitration Agreement”). Arbitration shall be before either (1) JAMS (formerly known as Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services), www.jamsadr.com, or (2) the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), www.adr.org. If you initiate arbitration, you shall have the choice as between these two arbitration forums; if Sofive Soccer Centers initiates arbitration, it shall have the choice as between these two arbitration forums.
WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THE DEFINITION OF DISPUTES BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.
</p><h2>Class Action Waiver</h2><p>
By using the Digital Properties, you agree that the arbitration of any Dispute (as defined below) shall be conducted on an individual, not a class-wide basis, and that no such arbitration proceedings may be consolidated with any other arbitration or other legal proceedings involving Sofive Soccer Centers or any other person. You further agree that you, and anyone asserting a claim through you, will not be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, or consolidated proceeding against Sofive Soccer Centers. We and you agree that the arbitrator of any Dispute between us may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claim (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action).
If the foregoing class action waiver (“Class Action Waiver”) or any portion thereof is found to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable, then the Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable, and the Dispute will be decided by a court. Any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is invalid, illegal, unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
</p><h2>Definition of Dispute</h2><p>
Except as described below, the term “Dispute” in this Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Sofive Soccer Centers regarding any aspect of your relationship with Sofive Soccer Centers, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including without limitation fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal, statutory or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of these Terms, except for the scope, enforceability and interpretation of the Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.
However, “Disputes” SHALL NOT include claims that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is invalid, unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable, or any claim for public injunctive relief, i.e., injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting alleged unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the general public. Such claims may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
</p><h2>How Will the Arbitration Work?</h2><p>
Either you or Sofive Soccer Centers may initiate arbitration proceedings. The arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a representative or class arbitration.
If you or Sofive Soccer Centers initiate arbitration, you and we have a choice of doing so before JAMS or the AAA:
For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols for Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.
Which particular rules apply in AAA arbitration will depend on how much money is at issue. For less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes/Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.
If required for the enforceability of the Arbitration Agreement under the Federal Arbitration Act, Sofive Soccer Centers will pay all arbitrator’s costs and expenses. If not, those costs will be paid as specified in the above-referenced rules.
Where Will the Arbitration Be Held?
You can bring the arbitration in either New York or in the state where you live if there is a JAMS or AAA in that state. In the event that Sofive Soccer Centers initiates an arbitration, it will only do so in the state where you live before either JAMS or AAA, unless there is no JAMS or AAA in your state, in which case Sofive Soccer Centers may initiate the arbitration in New York. As set forth in “Governing Law” section below, the arbitrator will apply New York law.
